	  <p>We hope that you have a pleasant and safe trip to Per√∫ and wish to request that you please take a few minutes to read the following useful information.</p>
	  <p>Before travelling, make sure if you need a visa to come to Peru and that you are carrying a valid passport.</p>
	  <p>DO NOT ride a taxi outside the airport. There are several taxi companies which you can hire before leaving Immigration. The more affordable is Taxi Green.</p>
	  <p><strong>HOTELS:</strong> The Congress has special rates on 3 hotels, but you need to book them through our wep page when you register. We will have return transportation from these hotels to the Congress's site (PUCP's campus) and we will provide timetables and schedules. When arriving at the hotel, hand your passport to the receptionist, as they need to photocopy it so that you can get the international visitor's tax exemption.</p>
