		<h2>Constitution</h2>
		<h4>Constitution of the International Society for Universal Dialogue</h4>
		<p>We the Members of the International Society for Universal Dialogue, in order to investigate and articulate the basic principles of universality systematically, rationally, and comprehensively—working to promote a world-wide understanding of these principles, striving to help generate universal world-consciousness towards the gradual emergence of a decent world order, and aspiring to actualize the highest and richest human values in art, science, politics, education, and social life—do agree to declare the following statement as the constitution of the International Society for Universal Dialogue.</p>
		<h6>Articl I</h6>
		<p>The official name of the society shall be “The International Society for Universal Dialogue” to be incorporated in the state of Maine, USA.</p>
		<h6>Article II</h6>
		<p>Scholars, especially philosophers, from all the countries of the world without exception, are entitled to membership in the Society without any discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, nationality, religion, sexual preference, or social class. The democratic way of thinking and acting shall be the guiding principle of all decisions which determine the plans and projects of the Society.</p>
		<h6>Article III</h6>
		<p>The ISUD acknowledges that it was the idea of Universalism that gathered the Society together in Warsaw in November, 1989; and further acknowledges and honors its close relationship with the publication Dialogue and Universalism which provides a forum in which all members of ISUD have the opportunity to communicate and exchange their views.</p>
		<h6>Article IV</h6>
		<ol>
			<li>The main purpose of the Society is to promote, in theory and in practice, the ideals of universality as the most effective means for the gradual realization of a decent, peaceful, and just world order. To achieve this purpose, the members of ISUD shall try—by means of scholarly work, regional and international conferences, as well as personal and collective work —to explore and share important areas of human knowledge and experience.</li>
			<li> More specifically, the purpose of the Society is to evoke and invigorate a global consciousness; that is, the existential awareness that all the peoples of the world belong to one species, the human species, and accordingly have the same fundamental stock of needs, aspirations, and capacities. This involves the recognition that these needs, aspirations, and capacities cannot be adequately realized under conditions of selfish competition, violence, and exploitation but under conditions of peace, cooperation, and freedom. It also involves recognition of the responsibility to other species, and to the preservation and restoration of the health and beauty of all eco-systems on the planet.</li>
